Put the codes in the box, press Ctrl+U to paste into emacs, (if you have any issue with the hotkey, feel free to have me make one that works for you)

Important!
You will need to delete # and {}, and manually add them back, just do it. (or you can start a pull and make them work, which would be awesome)
You will need to exit this program in the icon menu, just closing the messagebox will not exit the program.

This tool only works in windows since it's done by Autohotkey.
